## **The Victory Trap**

You know that feeling, right? You're on ***fire*** in Marvel Rivals. Five wins in a row. Your aim is sharp, your team reads your mind before you even move, and every ability lands perfectly.

For a moment, you feel ***unstoppable***—like you've finally cracked the code and become the player you always wanted to be.

Then something weird happens.

Your next match? Everything falls apart. Your new teammates don't seem to understand what a ***team*** is.

Your opponents? They move like they've been practicing for a thousand hours. You lose. Then again. And again.

> *Think the matchmaking feels off? You're not alone. Watch this deep dive.*

Five brutal losses later, you're slumped in your chair, wondering: "Did I ever actually get ***good***, or was the game just... letting me win?"

You're not crazy for thinking this. And honestly? You might be onto something.

## **Meet the Invisible Puppet Master**

 Welcome to the world of **Engagement Optimized Matchmaking (EOMM)**—a system that quietly decides whether you'll feel like a champion or a failure.

 Think of it like this:

**The old way (Skill-Based Matchmaking**): The game looks at how good you are and finds someone **equally** good to fight. Fair and simple. You win because you played better. You lose because they played better.

**The new way (EOMM)**: The game looks at everything about you—how many times you've logged in this week, if you just bought a cool new skin, even how frustrated you seem.

Then it matches you in a way that keeps you hooked. It's not about fair fights. It's about **keeping you playing**.

## **The Secret in the Fine Print**

Here's where it gets wild. A company called Activision literally filed a ***patent*** describing exactly how this works.

They even gave it a fancy name: "**Engagement Optimized Matchmaking**."

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1765301825930/f8cfe143-74de-4a86-9720-37e79d55e39e.png align="center")

The patent explains things like:

* **The cool skin trick:** If someone buys a new weapon or outfit, match them in games where it performs *really* well. They'll feel good about their purchase and want to buy more.
    
* **The mercy algorithm:** If you're losing too much and about to quit, the game quietly gives you an easier opponent—not to be nice, but to keep you from leaving.
    
* **The mood reader:** The system constantly checks if you're frustrated. It's watching. **Always watching.**
    

 Does it sound creepy? Kind of. But here's the thing—**It works**.

## **The Marvel Rivals Smoking Gun**

 Marvel Rivals players noticed something strange. Really strange.

 They started checking each other's win rates and found something impossible: almost ***everyone*** had exactly 50% wins and losses. Not 48%. Not 52%. **Dead center at 50%.**

---

That shouldn't happen naturally. If the game was truly fair, some players would be at 60%, some at 40%, some everywhere in between.

But when ***everyone*** ends up at 50%, it feels less like luck and more like... design.

 Players describe a clear pattern: win five games straight, then lose five games straight. Win, win, win, ***lose, lose, lose***.

 One frustrated Diamond-ranked player said it perfectly: *"****Even when I win, it feels hollow. I know the game is playing me like a violin****."*

> The Real Problem with Marvel Rivals

## **But Wait... What If It's Actually Just Broken?**

 Here's the interesting part. Not everyone thinks EOMM is the villain. Some players think the real problem is simpler: **the ranking system is just badly designed**.

 Marvel Rivals' ranked mode has issues:

\- You gain more points for winning than you lose for losing.

\- There's a "**free pass**" feature that erases losses (which inflates everyone's rank)

\- Games are super short, so bad players can spam matches until they accidentally climb too high

---

The result? The visible ranks mean almost nothing. You'll find brand-new players ranked the same as veterans.

When the ranking system is broken, every frustrating loss ***feels*** like the algorithm is rigging things against you.

## **What About Other Games?**

**Valorant** lets you play one game, get matched, done. Hidden and mysterious.

**Counter-Strike 2** lets you use websites like FACEIT where real people review matches and the system is transparent. You ***know*** the rules.

**Marvel Rivals** feels like something in between—transparent enough that players ***know*** something is off, but hidden enough that nobody has proof.

> *How do other competitive games compare?*

## **The Real Question**

Here's what keeps me up at night: At what point does a ***game*** become a ***system designed to manipulate you***?

If the game gives you an easy win when you're frustrated to keep you playing, is that kind? Or is it treating you like a lab rat?

I don't have a perfect answer. But I know this: whether **EOMM** is real or whether the ranking system is just broken, it points to something bigger.

Games are becoming less about ***competition*** and more about ***engagement metrics***. Less about fair fights and more about keeping you hooked.

The old games asked: "Is this match fair?"

The new games ask: "Will this match keep them playing?"

Those are very different questions.

## **The Only Thing That Matters**

So is your game rigged? Maybe. Probably. But here's the truth nobody talks about:

**YOU** decide whether to keep playing. You decide if a hollow win feels good. You decide if a frustrating loss is worth it.

If Marvel Rivals matches feel manufactured, maybe try something else. If you want transparent matchmaking, jump into a game with clear, honest systems.

Your time—and your trust—are worth more than a game that plays mind games with you.

Because in the end, you're not a data point. You're a player. And you deserve games that respect that.
