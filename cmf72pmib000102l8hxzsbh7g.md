## **Who Am I?**

I'm **Faisal Mujahid**, pursuing **master's in computer science** from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi, India with a passion for **game development and interactive storytelling**.

When I'm not diving deep into Unity and C# scripting, you'll find me analysing what makes games tick ‚Äì from the mechanics that hook us to the stories that stay with us long after we put down the controller.

My journey into game development started during my bachelor's studies, where I built a solid computer science foundation while focusing on what I love most: **creating interactive experiences**.

I've got hands-on experience crafting both 2D and 3D scenes in Unity, and I genuinely enjoy the challenge of turning wild game ideas into playable prototypes.

## **Why I'm Here**

Here's the thing ‚Äì **my passion for blogging comes from being a game developer myself**. I don't just play games; I dissect them. I want to share my thoughts on **what games are really trying to convey to players** beyond the surface level.

Whether it's the psychological horror of an indie thriller or the brilliant mechanics hidden in a racing game, I believe every game has a story worth exploring.

## **What You Can Expect**

On this blog, you‚Äôll find content across **three core categories**:

### üéÆ Game Dissection Lab

Where I perform **detailed reviews of games** and break down the psychology of the developers behind them. It‚Äôs not just about whether a game is fun ‚Äî it‚Äôs about *why* it works.

### üïµÔ∏è Hidden Realms: Gaming's Untold Stories

Every game has a backstory beyond what you play on screen. Here, I explore the **hidden facts, untold histories, and behind-the-scenes stories** of games and their development.

### ‚öôÔ∏è The Game Engine: How Games Really Work

Curious about what goes on under the hood? In this section, I explain **how specific features and mechanics are designed and implemented**, translating complex technical concepts into digestible insights.

üëâ To know more about these categories, make sure to check out their dedicated pages for a deeper dive!.
