## **Who Am I?**

I'm **Faisal Mujahid**, pursuing **master's in computer science** from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University, Delhi, India with a passion for **game development and interactive storytelling**.

When I'm not diving deep into Unity and C# scripting, you'll find me analysing what makes games tick – from the mechanics that hook us to the stories that stay with us long after we put down the controller.

My journey into game development started during my bachelor's studies, where I built a solid computer science foundation while focusing on what I love most: **creating interactive experiences**.

I've got hands-on experience crafting both 2D and 3D scenes in Unity, and I genuinely enjoy the challenge of turning wild game ideas into playable prototypes.

## **Why I'm Here**

Here's the thing – **my passion for blogging comes from being a game developer myself**. I don't just play games; I dissect them. I want to share my thoughts on **what games are really trying to convey to players** beyond the surface level.

Whether it's the psychological horror of an indie thriller or the brilliant mechanics hidden in a racing game, I believe every game has a story worth exploring.

## **What You Can Expect**

I'm here to share:

* **Deep dives into game mechanics** and what makes them work
    
* **Developer insights** from someone who's been on both sides of the screen
    
* **Honest opinions** on games that deserve more (or less) attention
    
* **Technical breakdowns** that actually make sense
    

I love connecting with fellow developers, designers, and gaming enthusiasts who share this passion for interactive experiences.

 Whether you're into game jams, cutting-edge gaming tech, or just want to discuss why certain gameplay concepts work so well, let's dive in together.
