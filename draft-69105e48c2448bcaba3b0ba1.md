## Introduction

I'll never forget the moment I first stepped onto **Tsushima Island**.

The wind blew through golden grass fields, cherry blossoms danced in the breeze, and I thought, "This is the **most beautiful game** I've ever played."

But Ghost of Tsushima isn't just about pretty landscapes—it's about a man forced to choose between **everything he was taught to believe** and everything he needs to do to save his people.

## **When Everything Falls Apart: Komoda Beach**

The game starts with a **devastating battle at Komoda Beach**. I watched Jin Sakai and his fellow samurai charge into battle against the Mongol invaders with honour, courage, and swords held high.

They believed in the **samurai code**—fight face-to-face, never use tricks, die with dignity.

They got **slaughtered**.

I'm not exaggerating. The beach turned red. I sat there, controller in hand, watching this young samurai crawl through piles of his fallen brothers, barely alive.
