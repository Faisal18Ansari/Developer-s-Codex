## Introduction

I'll never forget the moment I first stepped onto **Tsushima Island**.

The wind blew through golden grass fields, cherry blossoms danced in the breeze, and I thought, "This is the **most beautiful game** I've ever played."

But Ghost of Tsushima isn't just about pretty landscapes—it's about a man forced to choose between **everything he was taught to believe** and everything he needs to do to save his people.

## **When Everything Falls Apart: Komoda Beach**

The game starts with a **devastating battle at Komoda Beach**. I watched Jin Sakai and his fellow samurai charge into battle against the Mongol invaders with honour, courage, and swords held high.

They believed in the **samurai code**—fight face-to-face, never use tricks, die with dignity.

They got **slaughtered**.

> **Battle of Komoda Beach: lolmetwice**

I'm not exaggerating. The beach turned red. I sat there, controller in hand, watching this young samurai crawl through piles of his fallen brothers, barely alive.

That opening wasn't just shocking—it was a **statement**.

The game was telling me: "Your honour won't save you. Your traditions won't protect your people.

Now what are you going to do about it?"

## **The First Kill: When Jin Becomes the Ghost**

The moment that really stuck with me came later, during Jin's first **assassination**.

I remember sneaking behind an enemy guard, and when I pressed the button to perform a stealth kill, the game didn't just show the action—it showed Jin's **horror**.

> **Jin Struggling with Dishonorable Killing: VGS**

There was a flashback. His hands shaking. His breath rapid. This wasn't some cool assassin moment.

This was a man breaking everything he'd been taught since childhood. **Samurai don't stab people in the back**. They don't hide in shadows. They face their enemies with honour.

But Jin did it anyway. Because he had to.

What got me was how the game made me ***feel*** that weight. The music turned darker. Jin wasn't celebrating this new power—he was grieving the person he used to be.

## **Honor vs. Ghost: Two Ways to Fight, One Impossible Choice**

Throughout my playthrough, Ghost of Tsushima gave me two combat styles.

I could fight as a **samurai**—standing tall, challenging enemies to duels. Or I could embrace the Ghost—using smoke bombs, poison, fear tactics, and stealth kills to win at any cost.

Here's what made this brilliant: **both ways worked**.

The game never punished me for choosing honour. I could beat the entire game as a traditional samurai if I wanted.

But the story kept showing me the cost of that choice—more villages burned, more innocent people died while I fought "honourably."

The Ghost tactics were effective but heartbreaking, I saw how Jin's uncle, Lord Shimura, looked at him with disappointment and shame.

The man who raised Jin couldn't recognize him anymore.

## **The Sky Knows What You've Done**

Here's something amazing I discovered: **the weather changes based on how you play**.

When I fought honourably—standing in open combat, taking on enemies face-to-face—the skies stayed clear. **Sunlight** broke through clouds.

But when I started using Ghost tactics more—sneaking, assassinating, using poison—the weather turned darker. **Storm** clouds rolled in. Rain started falling.

The island itself seemed to reflect Jin's inner turmoil.

This wasn't just a cool visual effect. It was the game telling a **story without words.**

The world was mourning alongside Jin, showing that his choices weren't free—they came with a cost.

## **The Poison Mission: My Hardest Choice**

One mission forced me to make a **terrible decision**. Jin's allies wanted to poison the Mongols' food supply to weaken them before battle.

It was effective, strategic, and completely **dishonourable**.

Lord Shimura begged Jin not to do it. He argued that samurai don't use poison—it's a coward's weapon.

> **Jin Betrays the Samurai Code: VGS**

But Jin looked at the alternative: sending my people into a battle we'd likely lose, watching more innocents die.

Jin chose the **poison**. And I felt awful about it.

The game didn't tell me I was right or wrong. It just showed the consequences—the look of betrayal on Lord Shimura's face, the way Jin's hands trembled as he prepared the poison.

---

That's when I understood what Ghost of Tsushima was really about: **there are no clean choices in war**.

Sometimes doing the "right" thing means becoming someone you hate.

## **The Final Duel: When Love and Honor Collide**

The ending broke me. After defeating the Mongols and saving Tsushima, Jin faces his uncle in a final duel.

Not because Lord Shimura is evil—but because Jin's transformation into the Ghost has shamed the samurai code so much that the **Shogun ordered Jin's execution**, and Shimura must carry out that order.

The game gives you one real choice: kill **Shimura** to honour his wish for a warrior's death, or spare him and force him to live with shame.

I chose to spare him. I couldn't kill the man who raised me, even if he wanted me to.

But here's the thing—there's no happy ending. Jin walks away alone, an outlaw in his own homeland, having saved everyone but losing everything that defined him.

## **What This Journey Taught Me**

Ghost of Tsushima showed that **beauty and tragedy** can exist in the same moment.

Every time I climbed a mountain or rode through a bamboo forest, I was reminded of what Jin was fighting for—this island, these people, this breathtaking home.

But that beauty made the **sacrifices hurt more**. Knowing what Jin gave up—his honour, his family, his identity—to protect this place.

The game asks: What would you sacrifice to protect what you love?

I finished Ghost of Tsushima understanding that sometimes, the hardest battles aren't against enemies—they're against who we used to be.

**Have you played Ghost of Tsushima?**

**What did you choose in that final duel?**

**And more importantly—do you think Jin made the right choice becoming the Ghost?**

**Let's talk about it in the comments.**
