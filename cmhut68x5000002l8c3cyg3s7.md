## Remember when jumping off buildings actually made you feel like a badass assassin?

Picture this: You're scaling Notre Dame in Revolutionary **Paris**. The city sprawls beneath you in breathtaking detail.

Your fingers grip the ancient stone. The wind howls. This is it—the perfect **Assassin's Creed moment**.

Then your character's face melts off like a Salvador Dalí painting. You fall through the ground. And a notification pops up:

"Would you like to purchase more **Helix Credits** for $4.99?"

Welcome to modern Assassin's Creed, where the only thing getting assassinated is the **franchise** itself.

## **When Assassins Actually Assassinated Things**

There was a time when Assassin's Creed felt magical. Ezio Auditore wasn't just some video game character—he was your Renaissance bestie who made you care about Italian politics, **somehow**.

The parkour felt smooth, the hidden blade was satisfying, and that modern-day story with **Desmond**? People actually gave a damn.

But here's where everything went sideways.

After the Ezio trilogy proved massively profitable, Ubisoft's executives had a revelation:

"Why tell a great three-game story when we can milk this forever?"

And just like that, **Patrice Désilets** (the creative genius behind it all) left in 2010, and the annual release machine kicked into overdrive.

## **AC3: The Five-Hour Tutorial That Broke Everyone's Soul**

Assassin's Creed 3 tried something ambitious—make you play as the villain (**Haytham Kenway**) for HOURS before revealing the twist.

Cool idea, terrible execution. By the time you finally played as **Connor**, you were already exhausted from the longest tutorial in gaming history.

---

Then they killed Desmond in the most **anticlimactic** way possible. Five years of buildup, gone. Why?

Because Ubisoft had already planned sequels for the next decade, and wrapping up the modern-day story would've been inconvenient for the spreadsheet.

Lesson learned: When your ending is written by accountants instead of storytellers, **everyone can tell**.

## Unity: The Beautiful Disaster of 2014

**November 2014** will live in infamy. Assassin's Creed Unity launched with bugs so legendary they became memes—faceless characters with floating **eyeballs** and teeth, bodies twisted into **nightmare fuel**, players falling through Revolutionary Paris like it was made of hologram.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1762878334981/71c387c6-29df-48ae-9216-3fce62b7482d.avif align="center")

---

But it wasn't just buggy. It was fundamentally broken.

The parkour had terrible input delay. The story ignored the French Revolution for a mediocre **romance** plot.

And the microtransactions? Chef's kiss of corporate greed.

Ubisoft's response was unprecedented: they gave season pass holders an **ENTIRE NEW GAME** as compensation.

When your apology involves handing out Far Cry 4 for free, you know you messed up bad.

## Identity Crisis: When Vikings Replaced Assassins

After Unity's disaster and Syndicate's lukewarm reception, Ubisoft panicked and transformed Assassin's Creed into... **not** Assassin's Creed.

Origins (2017) turned the series into a massive RPG.

Gone were the tight urban environments built for parkour. Gone was social stealth. Instead: skill trees, loot systems, and level-gated combat.

You played as a mercenary in Odyssey and a Viking in Valhalla—neither had anything to do with actual **Assassins**.

Valhalla became the most profitable AC game ever with 20 million players. It's also the longest, most criticized, most padded game in the franchise.

> The ViewPoint Difference between old and new assassin’s creed: **Limber Fair Gaming**

One Reddit analysis found that 65% of story arcs are pure filler. The game literally paused the main story for **40-50** hours of busy work.

## Behind the Scenes: Corporate Rot

In 2020, Ubisoft's toxic workplace culture exploded into public view.

Reports of **misconduct**, **sexism**, and **abuse** flooded out. High-ranking creative leads were concerned.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1762879022134/0dff6c71-aa4b-4313-93fa-aa21da6f832d.png align="center")

The relentless annual release schedule had harmed developers and players alike.

Meanwhile, the original "narrative A-team" who built Assassin's Creed's lore? Scattered across multiple studios or gone **entirely**.

No creative visionary remained—just a corporate machine churning out instalments.

## The Monetization Nightmare

In 2025, Ubisoft had the **audacity** to claim microtransactions "make the player experience more fun."

The internet's response? "Are you kidding me?"

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1762879059171/34eb75a9-a53e-4621-9f3a-74295b2d41f5.png align="center")

> Source: Full Assassin's Creed Valhalla microtransaction store revealed, TweakTown

One monetization consultant spent **$100** on Unity's biggest Helix credit pack as an experiment.

Result? He had **$56** leftover with nothing to buy, and paying to win made the game boring—smoke bombs replaced actual stealth strategy.

Then there's **The Crew** shutdown and Ubisoft's CEO claiming "nothing is eternal"—essentially saying your **$70** game is a temporary service, not a product.

> See the Microtransactions in Valhalla.

Over 1.4 million people signed a petition against this, and the **European Commission** might get involved.

## Shadows: How to Offend an Entire Country

Assassin's Creed Shadows might be the franchise's most controversial entry yet.

Ubisoft used footage of a 1,400-year-old Shinto shrine (Itatehyōzu) without permission—where players could destroy the altar with a sword. Shrine officials said if Ubisoft had asked, they would've **refused**.

The historical errors piled up: square tatami mats (**they're rectangular**), watermelons during cherry blossom season (**wrong season**), temples shown intact that had burned down **centuries** earlier.

The controversy reached Japan's Prime Minister's desk.

> For the full Controversy watch The Critical Gamer video.

A Japanese industry insider stated: "Japanese history deserves to be respected." Ubisoft Japan? **No comment**.

## Can the Hidden Blade Return?

Assassin's Creed started as a **Prince of Persia** sequel that couldn't fit on PS2.

It became a genre-defining franchise with **Ezio**. Then it lost its soul chasing trends, annual releases, and corporate targets.

Unity's disaster, toxic workplace culture, predatory monetization, RPG identity crisis, and now **cultural insensitivity**—it's a masterclass in how to destroy what made something special.

Here's the question that haunts the franchise: At what point does something change so much it's no longer itself?

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1762879535166/7c23ebac-6301-4a4c-9013-bb270e7dedd3.avif align="center")

Ubisoft has **five AC games** in development. Will they remember what made this series special? Or will they keep pumping out "anecdote machines" designed by spreadsheets instead of **storytellers**?

**Only time will tell. But I'm not holding my breath.**

──────────────────────────────────────────────────

**What about you?** **Which AC game was your breaking point?**

**Do you think Shadows can redeem this mess, or is the damage permanent?**

Drop your thoughts below—I need to know I'm not the only one who misses when Assassins actually, you know, assassinated things.
