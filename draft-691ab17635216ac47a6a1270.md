## **Introduction**

Picture this: You just finished making one of the greatest video games ever created. You're exhausted, proud, maybe dreaming about a vacation.

Then your boss walks up and says, “*Great job! Now do it again. You have* ***one*** *year. Starting... now.”*

That's exactly what happened to **Eiji Aonuma**, the man behind The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. Spoiler alert:

They made it. Also, spoiler alert: It nearly broke them.

## **The Rebellion That Started Everything**

After creating Ocarina of Time—a game so perfect people are still talking about it decades later—**Aonuma** was given a boring task: remix those dungeons for Master Quest.

But here's the thing: *"We made those dungeons thinking they were the best we could make,"* he said. **How do you improve on perfection**?

So instead of following orders, Aonuma started working on secret new dungeons for fun.

Then he walked up to his boss, legendary game designer **Shigeru Miyamoto**, and basically said, *"Can I make a brand new game instead?"*

Miyamoto's response? *"Sure... if you finish it in one year."*

Aonuma's immediate reaction? *"I was holding my head!"* Nothing says *"I'm ready to be a director"* like immediately regretting your life choices.

## **Making a Deal (Sort Of)**

Aonuma needed help. He asked **Yoshiaki Koizumi**, a brilliant co-worker, who had one condition: *"I'll help you... but only if we use MY unused idea."*

That idea? A time-loop mechanic from a cancelled board game where everything resets after **one week**.

Originally, they planned for seven in-game days. But after testing, they realized players would think: *"Do I have to go through an entire week again...?"*

---

So, they compressed it to three days—more intense, less exhausting.

When your game design philosophy is literally "let's make it less painful," you know you're onto something **special**.

## **The Secret Messages Hidden in the Game**

Here's where things get dark. The development team—about **40 people**—were working insane hours.

All-nighters. Weekends. Barely seeing their families.

And they started hiding their suffering inside the game itself.

The **carpenters** in Clock Town have dialogue like *"Tonight again are we staying up all night to finish this?"*

The script writer later admitted those were **direct complaints** from developers about mandatory overtime.

The Mayor's line about *"not bringing my wife into this"?* An inside joke about developers spending so much time at the office they weren't seeing their **families**.

Aonuma even started having **nightmares** about the game. He dreamed about being chased by **Deku Scrubs**, only to come into work the next day and see his colleague had designed the exact same scene.

---

*"How did you know my dream?"* he asked, genuinely confused.

When work stress invades your actual dreams, you've crossed a line.

## **The Offer They Refused**

Near the end, Miyamoto—seeing how destroyed his team was—offered to **delay** the game. Give them more time.

Aonuma's response? He got angry. "*There's no way we can do that now!* *We'll definitely make this in one year!".*

Years later, he admitted: *"I said something unbelievable to my boss!"* This is like running a marathon, getting offered a ride at mile 25, and screaming *"NO I'M FINE"* while actively dying.

Pride and momentum had taken over.

## **Fifteen Years of Trauma**

Fast forward to 2015. Miyamoto asks Aonuma to remake Majora's Mask for the Nintendo **3DS**. Aonuma's response? He basically said **no**.

*"I didn't want to open that lid,"* he explained. *"I knew as soon as I opened it, I would break out in cold sweat."*

For 15 years, he'd been trying to pretend the game didn't happen. The stress, the nightmares, the trauma—it was all locked away.

%[https://youtu.be/Hj6cXziHpjQ?si=xp3lEbv3D-Oc7G-I] 

But eventually, he agreed. And something amazing happened: fixing the **game's problems** became healing.

The team made a *"What in the World*" list—all the things wrong with the original.

By the end, Aonuma said something beautiful: *"My traumas from 15 years ago have finally disappeared!"*

## **The Accidental Masterpiece**

Here's the wild part: all those constraints—the one-year deadline, the asset reuse, the compressed time loop—accidentally created something **unique**.

Because they had to reuse character models from **Ocarina**, they turned Termina into a "**warped mirror**" of Hyrule.

Familiar faces in twisted new roles. It created an eerie, unsettling feeling no other Zelda game has matched.

The three-day system forced them to create depth instead of scale. A small world packed with **life**, where every character follows a detailed schedule.

Even Aonuma admits: "*Even 15 years after... no one created a game like this."*

---

The time loop that tortured players? It mirrored the developers' own repetitive, **exhausting cycle.**

The anxiety of the moon falling? That was the deadline hanging over everyone's heads.

The themes of grief, loss, and impending **doom**? Those were lived experiences.

## **The Lesson in the Madness**

Majora's Mask taught us that sometimes the most beautiful art comes from the most difficult circumstances. But there's a cost to that **beauty**.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1764093568452/3463c028-31fb-4856-8612-e01fe516a7d5.webp align="center")

Yes, they created a masterpiece. Yes, the game is still celebrated today. But was it worth the **nightmares**? The lost time with **families**? The 15 years of **trauma**?

As the Happy Mask Salesman would say: *"We truly went through some hardship, huh."*

Majora's Mask remains both an incredible achievement and a cautionary tale.

Time is precious. Deadlines are terrifying. And sometimes, magic is made through absolute chaos.

**Just... maybe don't try this at work. Seriously, please don't.**
