## Introduction

Picture this: You’re running up a crumbling palace wall, backflipping onto a ledge, and—SPLAT.

You’ve misjudged the jump and now you’re a **pancake** at the bottom of a pit. But wait! Instead of screaming at your TV and restarting from a checkpoint ten minutes ago, you just… undo it.

That’s the magic of **Prince of Persia**: The Sands of Time. And here’s the wildest part: the entire game exists because the developers got sick of dying in a Donald Duck platformer.

Yeah, you read that right. **Donald Duck**.

## **When Rage Creates Genius**

Back in the early 2000s, director **Patrice Désilets** was playing Donald Duck: He had a thought that would change gaming forever: “**Why can’t I just rewind a few seconds instead of replaying this whole level?**”

That moment of pure gamer rage became the foundation of Sands of Time. Instead of building a story first and then adding cool features, the team said, “**What if we built the entire game around a rewind button?”**

This is the genius of Sands of Time—the gameplay came first, and the story was crafted to make that gameplay make sense.

The **Dagger of Time** exists because of the rewind button, not the other way around.

## **The Flip-Book That Changed Everything**

So how does the rewind actually work? It’s simpler than you think.

The game records **snapshots** of everything—where you are, what enemies are doing, how fast you’re moving—every few moments.

Think of it like a flip-book. When you hit rewind, the game just flips backward through those snapshots.

But here’s the catch: The PlayStation 2, GameCube, and Xbox only had about **8 MB** of RAM to work with.

That’s less memory than a single photo on your phone. So.. the rewind was limited to about 10 seconds.

If you could rewind forever, there’d be no stakes. The **10-second** limit forced you to think fast and make smart decisions.

## **Making Failure Fun (No, Really)**

Here’s where things get wild. Because the rewind made failure **painless**, the developers could make the game harder.

Traditional platformers have to be forgiving because dying and restarting from a checkpoint is annoying. But Sands of Time said, “**What if dying wasn’t annoying anymore?**”

So they made jumps trickier, puzzles more complex, and platforming sequences way more challenging.

You weren’t just playing the game; you were getting better at it in real-time.

It’s the same philosophy modern games like Celeste and Dark Souls use today, but Sands of Time pioneered it back in **2003**.

## **Persian Architecture (With a Twist)**

The entire game takes place in one massive palace over **24 hours**.

No loading screens. No weird backtracking. Just constant forward momentum through gorgeous, spaces.

The palace draws from real **Indo-Islamic** architecture—pillars, balconies, courtyards.

But the developers broke the rules on purpose. Traditional Persian architecture loves symmetry. But symmetrical levels are boring.

So the game uses asymmetrical spaces to create dynamic movement and interesting challenges.

The game uses curtains that flutter to show you where to wall-run. Lighting highlights climbable ledges. Shadows tell you where it’s safe to land.

The environment itself is your guide, and it feels so natural you barely notice it’s teaching you.

When the palace starts crumbling during an earthquake, simple platforming becomes thrilling, cinematic chaos.

## **Playing a Jerk (And Loving It Anyway)**

Let’s be real: The Prince is kind of an asshole. He invades a palace for no good reason other than greed and glory.

He’s arrogant, reckless, and makes terrible decisions. And yet… you root for him.

The developers borrowed a trick from **Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho**. When you control a character’s actions, you empathize with their immediate goals—even if those goals are morally questionable.

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1763356229615/4e9e5ef5-5108-4aa2-86df-bae569be475c.png align="center")

---

As the game progresses, the Prince’s clothes tear—literally showing the hardships chipping away at his arrogance.

He learns to trust **Farah**. He’s forced to confront painful truths. By the end, he’s a different person.

And when he reverses time to save everyone, he erases his own growth and his relationship with Farah. It’s **beautiful** and **heartbreaking**.

## **The One Thing That Didn’t Work**

Let’s talk about combat. It’s… not great. The same animation philosophy that made parkour feel weighty and realistic made fighting feel sluggish.

> Checkout Leo’s video on Prince of Persia Combat.

Once you start an attack, you’re committed—no **canceling**, no quick **dodges**. The auto-targeting is finicky. Counter-attacks feel awkward.

Pro tip? Use the vaulting slash and wall dive moves. Stick to the “super speed” power. Avoid the “**slow motion**” and “**freeze time**” powers—they’re basically useless.

But honestly? The combat being clunky doesn’t ruin the game. It’s a **minor** flaw in a masterpiece.

## **What We Can Learn**

Sands of Time teaches us that the best innovations come from frustration.

Some developer got mad at Donald Duck, said “**there’s gotta be a better way**,” and changed gaming forever.

It also proves that making games more forgiving doesn’t make them less challenging. It makes them more fun.

> See the Interview with Jordan Mechner.

Respect your player’s time, and they’ll tackle way harder challenges with a smile.

Modern games often have it backward. They start with a story and cram gameplay into it.

Sands of Time proves the opposite works better: start with a fun mechanic, then build a world that justifies it.

## **Your Turn**

So here’s my question: What’s a game mechanic that was clearly born from developer frustration?

I’m convinced half of gaming’s best innovations came from devs rage-quitting their own prototypes.

**And real talk—have you ever activated a game system you immediately regretted?**

**Like the Prince and his defense system puzzle, have you worked hard to unlock something that made your life harder?**
